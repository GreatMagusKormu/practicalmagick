This tool was designed with a few thoughts in mind.

1) This tool runs of the Image Magick toolset.
It will not work without it!

2) Ideally the tool should help reduce the time it
takes to create Rainmeter Button Meter Images.

3) This tool is designed so that you can run it from
a shortcut or a meter in rainmeter. Setup a shortcut
and fire away!

Example on using the tool in a shortcut or meter:
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -file "D:\Program Files\Practical Magick\PracticalMagick.ps1"

So in essence this is just a quick way to use a powershell
script to make life easier when using the Image Magick toolset
to create Button Meter images for Rainmeter.
