This tool was designed with two thoughts in mind.

1) This tool runs of the Image Magick toolset.
It will not work without it!

2) Ideally the tool should help reduce the time it
takes to create Rainmeter Button Meter Images.

So in essence this is just a quick way to use a powershell
script to make life easier when using the Image Magick toolset
to create Button Meter images for Rainmeter.
